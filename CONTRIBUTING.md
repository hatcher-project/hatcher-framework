CONTRIBUTING
============

Any contribution is welcome.

All contributions must be tested following as much as possible the current test structure.

- One class = one test file and the class must be annotated with ``@covers``
- One class method = one method in the test class
- Complex tests must be placed in the ``scenario`` directory 

Look at current tests in ``test/suites`` for more informations
