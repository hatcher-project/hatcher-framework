Hatcher Framework
=================

This package contains the base library for Hatcher CMF. The framework doesn't try to reinvent the wheel and is built on the top of 
**existing components** thus this package does not aim to be usable as a standalone.

**WIP** That's a work in project freshly open sourced from the refactoring of past project.
