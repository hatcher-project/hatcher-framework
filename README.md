Hatcher Framework
=================

A web and cli framework that aims to provide a **comfortable and flexible higher level web dev experience**.

The framework doesn't try to reinvent the wheel and is built on the top of 
**the best hand picked existing components** available.

**WIP** That's a work in project freshly open sourced from the refactoring of past project.
